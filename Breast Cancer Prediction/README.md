# Summary of Breast Cancer Prediction Project:
The objective of this project was to predict breast cancer using classification models. The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data and is called the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set." The dataset contains various features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass. The features are used to predict whether the mass is **malignant (M)** or **benign (B)**.

Three classification algorithms, namely **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**, were employed for the breast cancer prediction task. After evaluating the models, it was found that the **Random Forest** algorithm yielded the best results.

## The project followed the following steps:
